The color scheme for this project is:
    *Primary: #173D23
    *Secondary: #F2EEE3
    *Tertiary: #549227 // Note: the tertiary color does not meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for text contrast; 
                         // we can use this as an accent color on the site, but it can't be used for text.
                         // we can test color contrast using this site: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
                         // our primary color scored >10 on this site, so it can be used for any text, of any size/weight
                         // this will be taken care of before iteration #2
